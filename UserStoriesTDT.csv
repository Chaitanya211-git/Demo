ABCP Terms are being simplified to only use/share Estimated Subjects Base, and discontinue sharing Est Subject Premium - Base is more generic and can apply to all premium basis types, whereas Premium only applies to Earned, Written and In-Force Premium Basis types  2. As part of this, we are going to:  a. Simplify the calculations wherever Est Subject Premium & Est Subject Base are used to and consistently use Estimated Subject Base going forward (Proposal, Quotes, Firm Order, Validations) b. Set the values for Estimated Subject Premium = Estimated Subject Base whenever the Premium Basis = Earned, Written, In-Force c. Always show Est Subject Base to the Underwriters d. Always allow a manual override of the calculated values   Changes needed in these areas: 1. Quote   a. Proposal Contract 100% ECP Calculation = Estimated Subject Base * Premium Rate Tooltip = Estimated Ceded Premium will be calculated based on Estimated Subject Base * Premium Rate Ensure the values for Estimate Subject Premium = Estimated Subject Base if Premium Basis = In Force, Written, Earned  This should be re-evaluated each time Premium Basis changes Estimated Subject Premium changes Estimated Subject Base changes  b.
